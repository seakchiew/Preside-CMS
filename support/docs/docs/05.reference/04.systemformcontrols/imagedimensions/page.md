title: "Form control: Image Dimensions"
---

The `imageDimensions` form control provides a neat interface for inputting dimensions. The value it provides, and expects as input, takes the form "(width)x(height)", e.g. `1920x1080`.

### Arguments

The control does not accept any arguments.

### Example

```xml
<field name="dimensions" control="imageDimensions" required="true" />
```
