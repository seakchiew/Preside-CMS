title: "Form control: Asset Storage Location Picker"
---

The `assetStorageLocationPicker` control is a very specific form control for selecting asset storage locations (see [[assetmanager]]). It is a simple extension of the [[formcontrol-select|select control]]. It takes no custom arguments of its own.

### Example

```xml
<field name="storageLocation" control="assetStorageLocationPicker" />
```
