The `manyToOneSelect` control is a special wrapper to the standard [[formcontrol-objectPicker|object picker control]], used by the system when creating setting automatically mapped form controls from preside object properties with `many-to-one` relationships.

If in doubt, use the [[formcontrol-objectPicker|object picker control]] when manually setting form controls in your form.
