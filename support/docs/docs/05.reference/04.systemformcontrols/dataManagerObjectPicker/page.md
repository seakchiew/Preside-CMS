---

The `dataManagerObjectPicker` control allows selection of _objects_ that appear in the data manager (not to be confused with the [[formcontrol-objectPicker|Object picker control]] that allows you to select records for a given data object). It is an extension of the [[formcontrol-select|select control]]. It accepts no custom arguments of its own.

### Example

```xml
<field name="objects" control="dataManagerObjectPicker" multiple="true" />
```
