## Overview




The Feature Service provides an API to preside's configured features.
This allows other systems within PresideCMS to check the enabled status
of features before proceeding to provide a page or perform some action.<div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-condensed"><tr><th>Full path</th><td>preside.system.services.features.FeatureService</td></tr><tr><th>Wirebox ref</th><td>FeatureService</td></tr><tr><th>Singleton</th><td>Yes</td></tr></table></div>
