## i18n (Internationalization)

The term i18n comes from the desire not to write down the rather long word, internationalization, which starts with an *i* followed by 18 other letters before ending with an *n* - i18n. The subject of i18n deals with making your content and/or interface usable across nations, dialects and cultures. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Translated labels and other content
* Formatting of numbers
* Formatting of dates

The PresideCMS admin interface provides a translation system to allow you to define the system's labels and descriptions in a standard way that allows translation. Date and number formatting is a work in progress.
